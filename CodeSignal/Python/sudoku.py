"""
Sudoku is a number-placement puzzle. The objective is to fill a 9 × 9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3 × 3 sub-grids that compose the grid contains all of the digits from 1 to 9.

This algorithm should check if the given grid of numbers represents a correct solution to Sudoku.

Example

For
grid = [[1, 3, 2, 5, 4, 6, 9, 8, 7],
        [4, 6, 5, 8, 7, 9, 3, 2, 1],
        [7, 9, 8, 2, 1, 3, 6, 5, 4],
        [9, 2, 1, 4, 3, 5, 8, 7, 6],
        [3, 5, 4, 7, 6, 8, 2, 1, 9],
        [6, 8, 7, 1, 9, 2, 5, 4, 3],
        [5, 7, 6, 9, 8, 1, 4, 3, 2],
        [2, 4, 3, 6, 5, 7, 1, 9, 8],
        [8, 1, 9, 3, 2, 4, 7, 6, 5]]
the output should be
solution(grid) = true;

For
grid = [[8, 3, 6, 5, 3, 6, 7, 2, 9],
        [4, 2, 5, 8, 7, 9, 3, 8, 1],
        [7, 9, 1, 2, 1, 4, 6, 5, 4],
        [9, 2, 1, 4, 3, 5, 8, 7, 6],
        [3, 5, 4, 7, 6, 8, 2, 1, 9],
        [6, 8, 7, 1, 9, 2, 5, 4, 3],
        [5, 7, 6, 9, 8, 1, 4, 3, 2],
        [2, 4, 3, 6, 5, 7, 1, 9, 8],
        [8, 1, 9, 3, 2, 4, 7, 6, 5]]
the output should be
solution(grid) = false.
